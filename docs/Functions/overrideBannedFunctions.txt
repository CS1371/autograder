Function Name: overideBannedFunctions.m
Inputs: parentFolderPath - a string representing the folder where the banned functions folders will be.
        bannedFunctions - a cell vector of all the banned functions. Can be a string IF it is only one banned function.
        problemNumber - a double representing the current homework problem number.
        problemName - a string representing the function name for the homework (ie, the corresponding function name for the problem number.)
Outputs: bannedFunctionsFolderPath - a string representing the path to the banned functions for a specific problem.
Specific Uses: runSolutions.m
Description: Given a set of banned functions and the immediate folder, overrideBannedFunctions will create empty .m files for each of these banned functions. Since MATLAB first looks in the current folder for a function definition, this effectively eliminates the specified functions. There is currently talk of adding getMostRecentFiles.p as a permanent banned function.
