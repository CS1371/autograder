Description: comparePlots compares two plots. These plots are given as structures, with a variable amount of fields representing XData, YData, etc. The result has the same fields as the two input plots; if these fields differ, comparePlots might throw an error. This is considered a bug, not a feature, and will be fixed in a future version.
