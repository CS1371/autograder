# Cheat Detection

This module is concerned with cheat detection.

## Results

Cheat Detection results are given as confidence statistics. In other words,
when it says "95%", that means that the code is _95%_ identical.

Cheat Detection Threshold is set as default at 95%; it can be changed by
editing the compile time flag THRESHOLD.
