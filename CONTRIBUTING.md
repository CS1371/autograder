# Contributing to the Autograder

Software is best done in groups - the more, the merrier! No matter how many hours our team puts in, it would be impossible for us
to locate and resolve every bug in the grader. With an application as large as this, it's important that the community
help us test and improve.

Below, you'll find some guidelines for becoming a contributor and a part of the team

## Prerequisites

- You'll need to have a Georgia Tech GitHub account.
- You'll need to have installed git-scm locally

## Steps

First, and this is most important - **make sure your bug/feature isn't already
under [issues](https://github.gatech.edu/CS1371/autograder/issues)! If it is, just comment on that issue, and possibly ask to be
assigned to it. If you don't find your issue, **log it first**

### Logging an issue

Logging is simple and intuitive. Your issue need not be long, but must include at least the following:

- Name (concise description of problem)
- Description (Longer description of problem)
- Steps to recreate (What did you do before the problem occurred)
- Possible solutions, if any (What do you propose to fix this bug)

We use GitHub flavored Markdown for our issues.

After logging your issue, fork the repository and make your changes! Then, create a Pull Request into Development.
